  string intro="There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space, and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow - between science and superstition. And it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call the Twilight Zone.";
  string mapleInto="Which reads, "Maple Street." PAN DOWN until we are shooting down at an angle toward the street below. It's a tree-lined, quiet residential American street, very typical of the small town. The houses have front porches on which people sit and swing on gliders, conversing across from house to house. Steve Brand polishes his car parked in front of his house. His neighbor, Don Martin, leans against the fender watching him. A Good Humor man rides a bicycle and is just in the process of stopping to sell some ice cream to a couple of kids. Two women gossip on the front lawn. Another man waters his lawn. Maple Street, U.S.A., late summer. A tree-lined little world of front porch gliders, hop scotch, the laughter of children, and the bell of an ice cream vendor.";

  string meteorConvo="At the sound of the roar and the flash of light it will be precisely 6:43 P.M. on Maple Street. At this moment one of the little boys, Tommy, looks up to listen to a sound of a tremendous screeching roar from overhead. A flash of light plays on both their faces and then it moves down the street past lawns and porches and rooftops and then disappears.\n";

  string SteveMrsMeteor="MRS.BRAND:(from her porch)Steve? What was that?\nSTEVE:(raising his voice and looking toward porch) Guess it was a meteor, honey. Came awful close, didn't it?\nMRS.BRAND:"Too close for my money! Much too close.\n"
  
  string meteorSetting="Ext. Street Day Slow pan across the porches again Interspersed with MED. CLOSE SHOT, man screwing a light bulb on a front porch, then getting down off the stool to flick the switch and finding that nothing happens.\n Med. shot Man:Working on an electric power mower. He plugs in the plug, flicks on the switch of the power mower, off and on, with nothing happening.\nMed. close shot through window of a front porch Woman on a porch:Pushing her finger back and forth on the dial hook. Her voice is indistinct and distant, but intelligible and repetitive.\nWoman Next Door:Operator, operator, something\'s wrong on the phone, operator!\nMed. close shot Mrs. Brand As she comes out on the porch and calls to Steve.\n"

  string MeteorSetting2="While out on the curb you see Pete Van Horn  A tall, thin man who is standing in front of his house.\nVan Horn:I'll cut through the backyard...See if the power's still on on Floral Street. I'll be right back.\n Long shot Van Horn:As he walks past the side of his house and disappears into the backyard. You look at the hammer on his belt.\nUntil we're looking at ten or eleven people standing around the street and overflowing to the curb and sidewalk. In the background is Steve Brand's car.";
